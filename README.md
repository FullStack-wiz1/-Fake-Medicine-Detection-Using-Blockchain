# Fake Medicine Detection Using Blockchain

## Abstract
Counterfeit medicines threaten global health by undermining treatment efficacy and endangering lives. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and traceability of pharmaceutical products. By creating an immutable ledger of transactions, blockchain enables stakeholders to verify medicine legitimacy, track its journey, and swiftly detect counterfeit drugs. This approach aims to enhance public health and trust in the pharmaceutical industry.

## Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures transparency and immutability.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates verification and compliance.
- **Decentralized System**: Enhances security and traceability.

## Architecture
- **User Interface**: Web and mobile access for stakeholders.
- **Application Layer**: Handles user requests and smart contract interactions.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Decentralized ledger for transaction validation.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enforces rules and automates transactions.
- **Data Layer**: Manages and secures pharmaceutical data.

## Process
1. Manufacture and assign unique IDs to drugs.
2. Record details on the blockchain and affix QR codes.
3. Scan QR codes to verify authenticity throughout the supply chain.
4. Patients can also verify medicine authenticity via QR codes.

## Future Work
- **Scalability Solutions**: Explore techniques to handle increasing transaction volumes.
- **Interoperability Standards**: Facilitate data exchange between different blockchain networks.
- **Enhanced Traceability**: Integrate IoT devices for improved tracking.
